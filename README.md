<li>instancing structures or instances from one or more source files</li>
<li>instancing all instances from one or more source files</li>
<li>filling empty 3D space (within an arbitrary box) with a dielectric material</li>
<li>flattening instances into uniquified structures</li>
<li>writing out a single file with resultant edits</li>
</ul>
